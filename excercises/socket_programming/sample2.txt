RTOS Fundamentals
A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a specialized OS designed to handle tasks that must
be completed within strict time constraints. Unlike general-purpose operating systems
(GPOS), which prioritize multitasking and user interaction, an RTOS ensures predictable
and timely execution of tasks, making it ideal for time-sensitive applications.
RTOS is commonly used in environments where numerous external events must be
processed quickly and within defined deadlines. Examples include industrial automation,
flight control, telecommunications, real-time simulations, and medical devices.

RTOS is classified into 3 types:

1. Hard Real-Time Operating System:
A hard real-time operating system is used when we need to complete tasks by a given
deadline. If the task is not completed on time then the system is considered to be failed.
For example, the pacemaker. A pacemaker has flexible, insulated wires (leads) that are
placed in one or more chambers of the heart. These wires deliver electrical pulses to adjust
the heart rate. And these wires require a hard real-time operating system.

2. Soft Real-Time Operating System
A soft real-time operating system is used where few delays in time duration are acceptable.
That is if the given task is taking a few seconds more than the specified time then also no
critical damage takes place.
For example, telephone switches, the sending or receiving of the call can take some time.
It will not be considered a failure.

3. Firm Real-Time Operating System
A firm real-time operating system lies between the hard and soft real-time operating system.
A firm real-time system is one in which a few missed deadlines will not lead to total failure,
but missing more than a few may lead to complete or catastrophic system failure.
However, unlike a hard real-time task, even if a firm real-time task is not completed within
its deadline, the system doesn’t fail but the late results are merely discarded.
For example, in Video Conferencing, when a certain frame is being played, if some
preceding frame arrives at the receiver, then this frame is of no use and is discarded.

Key Features of Zephyr RTOS
Zephyr is a small yet powerful real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for resource
constrained embedded devices such as smart gadgets, sensors, and wearables. As an open-
source RTOS, it allows developers to use, modify, and improve it freely, fostering
innovation and collaboration.
One of Zephyr's key strengths is its efficiency on low-power devices, making it suitable for
applications requiring minimal energy consumption and high reliability. It supports a wide
range of processor architectures, including ARM, RISC-V, and x86, providing flexibility
across different hardware platforms.
18Zephyr’s modular architecture enables developers to select only the necessary features,
keeping the system lightweight and fast. This design makes Zephyr ideal for embedded
applications where realtime performance, security, and scalability are crucial.
