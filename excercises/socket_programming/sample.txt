System overview
The block diagram illustrates the system-level overview of the project, which is built around a
RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture. It highlights the interaction between the
processing core, memory units, and various peripherals through an AXI (Advanced eXtensible
Interface) bus, ensuring seamless data communication and system efficiency.

NEORV32 Core:
The NEORV32 is a soft-core RISC-V processor running on the Lattice FPGA. It is responsible
for executing the Zephyr-based firmware, managing tasks, and controlling peripherals such as
I2C, GPIO, and UART. The processor fetches data from the HTU21D sensor, processes it, and
sends it to the host display. Its flexibility and open-source nature make it an ideal choice for
embedded applications like this temperature monitoring system.

External Interrupt Controller:
The External Interrupt Controller handles hardware interrupts from peripherals, ensuring real-
time responsiveness. Instead of constantly polling sensors and peripherals, the processor can
perform other tasks and respond only when an interrupt is triggered. This improves efficiency
and power consumption while ensuring timely data processing from the sensor and
communication interfaces.

CLINT:
CLINT stands for Core Local Interrupter. It is a component in RISC-V based systems that
handles timer interrupts and software interrupts for each individual RISC-V core. CLINT
provides a timer for each core, allowing for time-related operations and manages software-
generated interrupts, aiding in task scheduling and system management.

Timer:
The Timer module provides timekeeping and periodic scheduling for various tasks in the
system. It is essential for defining sampling intervals for temperature measurement and for
handling real-time operations within Zephyr RTOS. Timers ensure that sensor data is acquired
at regular intervals, making it crucial for stable and predictable system behaviour.

AXI Bus:
The AXI Bus serves as the high-speed data highway connecting the processor, memory, and
peripherals. It ensures efficient data transfer between the NEORV32 core and components like
RAM, I2C, GPIO, and UART. A well-structured bus system is needed to prevent bottlenecks,
ensuring smooth communication and optimal system performance.

Boot ROM:
Boot ROM holds the firmware code necessary for system startup and operation. Since it is
read-only, it ensures that the processor always executes a predefined program upon power-up,
preventing accidental overwrites. This memory is essential for a stable boot process and system
reliability.

Data RAM:
Data RAM is used for storing runtime data, including sensor readings, system variables, and
program execution data. It is necessary for holding temporary values that are actively used by
the processor. The availability of adequate RAM enhances system performance, ensuring
smooth execution of tasks without memory bottlenecks.

I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit):
The I2C module enables communication between the processor and temperature sensor. It uses
the I2C protocol, a simple and power-efficient method for sensor interfacing. This module is
essential for fetching real-time temperature data, making it a key component of the system.
GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output):
The GPIO module allows the processor to control external components, such as LEDs. In this
project, it is used to toggle an LED. GPIO is essential for adding basic control functions to the
system.

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter):
The UART module is responsible for serial communication between the NEORV32 processor
and the host PC. It allows real-time data logging, debugging, and visualization of sensor
readings. UART is necessary for monitoring data.
